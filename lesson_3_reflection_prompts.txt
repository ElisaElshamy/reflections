When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A respository is perfect when you want others to collaborate on a project.  This way they can access your code and even make enhancements to it!





Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to manually pull changes so that you know when you're overwriting your code with updates.  If Git did this automatically, you would constantly loose changes you're working on.
